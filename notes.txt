27 January 2020 – 7 February 2020 Report


27 January 2020:
* Groups were formed between developers and business analysts to come up with a system to complete for the next 5 days.
* We were combined with BA’s to brainstorm ideas. We ended up choosing a system called “Lost and Found” which could be used to retrieve lost items by uploading a picture of the item you found then describing it in a description form. The person who has lost an item can log their lost item in order to see if it might be on the database of lost items. 
* During the day I was learning the basic commands of gitbash and working with github, also about mongodb.
* Later on we presented the idea to our respective icep supervisors.
28 January 2020:
* Tasks were assigned on Trello by BA’s.
* As developers we choose the activities to be completed in order to develop a full system.
* I was doing the backend of the login page.
* Started researching about node.js, mongodb, basically MEAN.

30 January 2020
* Created the database data using xampp and myphpadmn.
